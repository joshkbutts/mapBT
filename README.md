# mapBT

An app where users can keep track of their travels on an interactive map as well as interact with other users by commenting on their travels.

Incorporated the Google Maps API through a React library to dynamically display map markers and information tiles about them on a userâ€™s profile in a NodeJS environment. Used Express, Knex, Objection and Postgres to create a database and pass data from the front end to the back end and persist and Passport for user creation and authentication.
